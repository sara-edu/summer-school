## Day 1 Introduction to Data Science

### What is reproducible research?

Definition of reproducible research.

> "The goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, understood, and verified." (Source: John Blischak, Alison Hill, Ben Marwick, Daniel Sjoberg, Will Landau (2024). CRAN Task View: Reproducible Research. Version 2024-06-14. URL [https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch.
](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html))

> "Research is reproducible when others can reproduce the results of a scientific study given only the original data, code, and documentation" (Source: Alston, J. M., & Rick, J. A. (2021). A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research. The Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, 102(2), e01801. [https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1801](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801))

Important parts of reproducible research.

  - **Data**: people can access your original data. 
  - **Code**: (visualization, tables, images, and statistics).
  - **Documentation**: (for example proposal, paper, thesis, slides, and websites).

How to accomplish reproducible research using data science?

R + Quarto

::: {.callout-important}
Here show a demo of a quarto document. The document should have data, code, and documentation. Also, demonstrate it converting into multiple formats.

This demo should help the participants to understand how using R and Quarto can help them to overcome the ðŸ˜“ pain of cut-copy-paste cycle.

### Introduction to R

What is open-access?

> "Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose." (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software))

What is R?

> "R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics."

Why to use R?

Here are a few screen-shots of top Reddit answers

How and from where to download R?

### Introduction to RStudio

- What is RStudio?

Soon, posit will launch their new data science IDE, *positron* (Source: <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron>) as well.

- How and from where to download RStudio?

- If R is there then why RStudio?

- How and why to use RStudio project?

### Introduction to Quarto

- Key parts/components

  - YAML
  - Code chunk
  - Documentation

- Headings

- Add images

- Teach code chunk in detail

## Day 2 Data Visualization

We will also learn when to make which plot in an order:

- bar plot
- histogram
- line plot
- dot plot
- correlation plot

We will use R package `ggplot2` to make plots and do the customization like:

- adding a theme
- making your own theme
- using ggplot extension plots
- adding text and statistics to the plot

Give them link of a few famous ggplot users like 

## Day 3 Research Design

Import data in R from your local computer

Types of variables

Format of data required in RStudio

## Day 4 Quantitative Analysis

Check data format, name of the variables, sample size & missing values (column and rows)

Plot missing values

### Why to learn statistics?

### Descriptive statistics

- central tendencies

- dispersion

- how to report descriptive statistics

### Correlation

- Correlation calculation

- Reporting correlation

### Regression

- Regression calculation

- How to report regression results

### Factor Analysis

### ANOVA

### t-Test, s-test, f-test


## Day 5 Publish using GitHub
