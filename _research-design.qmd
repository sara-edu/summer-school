::: panel-tabset
## Qualitative

Visible during the 1990s and in the 21st century.

-   **Narrative research** from the humanities ... one or more individuals to provide stories about their lives.

-   **Phenomenology** from philosophy and psychology ... description culminates in the essence of the experiences for several individuals who have all experienced the phenomenon.

-   **Grounded theory** from sociology in which the researcher derives a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the view of participants.

-   **Ethnography** from anthropology and sociology in which the research studies the shared patterns of behaviors, languages, and actions of an intact cultural group in a natural setting.

-   **Case study** researcher develops an in-depth analysis of a case ... collect detailed information using a variety of data collection procedures

## Quantitative

During the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century.

-   **Experimental Designs** seeks to determine if a specific treatment influences an outcome.

-   **Survey research** provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a **sample** of that **population**.

## Mixed Methods {visibility="hidden"}

Began in late 1980s

-   **Convergent mixed methods** collects both forms of data at the same time and integrates the information in the results.

-   **Explanatory sequential** quantitative studies followed by the qualitative study, the qualitative study was conducted to explain further/better the results of quantitative study.

-   **Exploratory sequential** qualitative study was done first then this study's results are used to do the quantitative study.

-   Transformative, embedded, or multi-phase

## The research topic[^22]

[^22]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

> "The topic is the subject or **subject matter** of a proposed study" like:

- "The topic becomes the **central idea** to learn about or to explore"

- "Topic **grounds us** and provides a **sign** of what we are studying."

## How to write a working Title?

::: callout-tip
"My study is about ......................................"
:::

## Good topic or question

-   "**Adds** to the pool of research knowledge in the literature available on the topic, ...

-   **Replicate** past studies, ...

-   Lifts up the voices of **under-represented groups** or individuals, ...

-   Helps to address **social justice**, or ...

-   **Transforms** the ideas and beliefs of the researcher."

## :mag: A new perspective or "angle" to the existing literature:

-   Studying an **unusual location** (e.g., rural India).

-   Examining an **unusual group** of participants (e.g., refugees).

-   Taking a **perspective** that may not be expected and reverses the expectation (e.g., why marriages do work rather than do not work).

-   Providing **novel means** of collecting data (e.g., collect sounds).

-   Presenting results in **unusual ways**.

-   Studying a **timely topic** (e.g., immigration issues)

## Studies addressing the problem

-   **Reviewing** studies that have examined the issue.

-   **Summarize** large groups of studies instead of individual ones.

-   **Justify** the importance of the study

-   To create **distinction** between past studies and the proposed one.

## Deficiencies in past literature

-   Topics have not been explored with a **particular group**, sample, or population;

-   The literature may need to be replicated or repeated;

-   The voices of underrepresented groups left

-   "Future research" to look for gaps.

## Significance of a study for audiences

-   3 or 4 reasons that the **study adds** to scholarly research and literature in the field.

-   3 or 4 reasons about how the study helps **improve practice**.

-   3 or 4 reasons as to why the study will improve **policy or decision making**.

> "Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought." <br><br>-- Albert Szent-Gyorgyi

## :books: Why literature review?

-   "literature review helps to determine whether the topic is **worth studying**, and it provides insight into ways in which the researcher can **limit the scope** to a needed area of inquiry."

-   "to consider whether the research topic can and should be researched"

## :books: [Purpose of Literature Review:]{style="color:#36013F"}

-   It shares with the reader the **results of other studies** that are closely related to the one being undertaken.

-   It relates a study to the larger, **ongoing dialogue** in the literature, filling in gaps and extending prior studies

-   It provides a framework for establishing the importance of the study as well as a benchmark for **comparing the results** with other findings.

## :books: [Lit. rev. sources]{style="color:#36013F"} {background-image="images/litref.png" background-size="contain" background-position="75%"}

## :sob: Literature Review Process[^24]

1.  Begin by identifying **key words.**

1.  Searching the **databases** like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR or you can also use website like [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) to download books and papers.

1.  Locate about 50 reports of research in **articles or books** related to research on your topic.

1.  Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those that are **central to your topic**.

1.  Designing a **literature map** ... a **visual picture of groupings** of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your particular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of research.

1.  Begin to **draft summaries** of the most relevant articles. Include precise references to the literature using an appropriate style guide like [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines).

1.  After **summarizing** the literature,

  - assemble the literature review, structuring it **thematically** or organizing it by **important concepts**.

  - This summary should also point toward the **methods** ...

  - It is at this point as well that you could advance a **critique of the past** literature and point our **deficiencies** in it and issues in its methods.

## "Good" research question[^23]

[^23]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

-   **Feasibility** given the time and resources available

-   Social importance, and

-   Scientific relevance

## Theory

> "“explains a certain phenomenon," ...

. . .

> "and the idea is that this explanation will hold in a wide range of settings.”

@sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

## The role of theory

-   Some research is aimed at **building theory** ...

-   other to **test** a theory ...

-   to **describe** what is going on, using an existing framework, instrument, or model.

## Deductive research

![](images/deductive.png){.absolute top=0 right=0 width=40%}

"The type of research in which a <br>specific expectation is deduced <br>from a general premise and is <br>then tested."

## Inductive research

![](images/inductive.png){.absolute top=0 right=0 width=40%}

"The type of research in which <br>general conclusions are drawn<br> from specific data."

(@chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018)

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"}[^29] [in Quan Research:]{style="color:#FF6347"}

[^29]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

-   Researchers often **test hypotheses** stemming from theories.

-   Broader theory **guiding** to the study hypotheses.

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"} [in Qual Research]{style="color:#FF6347"}

-   It may **generate a theory** as the final outcome of a study and place it at the end of a project

-   Sometimes it comes at the beginning and **provides a lens** that shapes what is looked at and the questions asked

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"} [in Mixed Methods]{style="color:#FF6347"}

-   Researchers may both **test** theories and **generate** them

-   Contain a theoretical framework within which **both** quantitative and qualitative data are collected

## [Quantitative Theory Use]{style="color:#0e6251"}

- **Causality:** means we would expect variable $X$ to cause variable $Y$.

- Does drinking one glass of red wine daily ($X$) *cause* you have a reduced risk for a heart attack ($Y$)?

- Do number of playing hours ($a$) and attendance ($b$) influence the marks in the exam ($z$)?

## Hypothesis (plural is hypotheses)

> "A tentative statement about empirical reality involving a relationship between two or more variables."

. . .

> "a tentative, yet testable, statement, which **predicts** what you expect to find in your **empirical** data." @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

. . .

*Example:* The higher the media budget, the higher the sales.

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

- **Variable:** "refers to a [characteristic or attribute]{style="color:#FF6347"} of an individual or an organization that can be measured or observed and that [varies]{style="color:#FF6347"} among the people or organization being studied."

- *Example*:Gender, age, socio-economic status; attitudes or behaviors such as racism, social control, political power, leadership.

## [Causality]{style="color:#0e6251"}

$$Red\;Wine \longrightarrow Heart\;attack$$ $$X \longrightarrow Y$$

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Independent variables:**

    -   Those that [influence, or affect outcomes]{style="color:#FF6347"} in experimental studies.

    -   They are [manipulated]{style="color:#FF6347"} in an experiment and thus independent of all other influences.

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Dependent variables:**

    -   Those that depend on the independent variables,

    -   They are the [outcomes or results]{style="color:#FF6347"} of the influence of the independent variables

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   Independent variable/Predictor variable

-   Dependent variable / Outcome variable

-   Confounding variable

-   Mediating variable

-   Moderating variable




## [Hypothesis Development: If-then statements]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   *Young women will more likely to express dissatisfaction with their body weight, when they are more frequently exposed to images of thin models in advertisements.*

-   *If young women are more frequently exposed to images of thin models in advertisements, then they will be more likely to express dissatisfaction with their body weight.*

## [Directional Hypothesis Development:]{style="color:#0e6251"}

"the direction of the relationship between the variables (positive/negative) is indicated"

-   *The greater the stress experienced in the job, the lower the job satisfaction of employees.*

-   *Women are more motivated than men.*

## [Non-directional Hypothesis Development:]{style="color:#0e6251"}

"postulate a relationship or difference, but offer no indication of the direction of these relationships or differences"

-   *There is a relation between arousal-seeking tendency and consumer preferences for complex product designs.*

-   *There is a difference between the work ethic values of American and Asian employees.*
